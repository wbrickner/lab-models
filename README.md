# Brickner Lab Models

All models are completely parametric/programmatic.  This means they are defined as a set of operations on primitive objects and shapes, which are then rendered to `.stl` files for slicing. 

All models are written in OpenSCAD or ImplicitCAD (extopenscad).

Feel free to use these models in your workspace.

Models:

- Rack 
	- space for magnets (to act on the fluid and suspended particles inside the tubes)
